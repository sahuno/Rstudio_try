## R Markdown
# This is the beginning of the end
## But actually we left the middle out
### Probably we can call this the end; header with 3 harshes to see how it differs from the rest of the headrs above

This is an R Markdown document created by Samuel Ahuno to test R markdown utility. I'm not sure I've effective used this befpre, but i guess the journey of a 1000 miles begin with a step so I am open to the possibilities that comes with it. To learn more about this cecheck out the official R markdown website. to learn more about my project; check out my  github page; wishing you the very best; Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
```{r summary(cars$speed)}
head(cars$speed)
```
## Things i can use markdown for
- memo's
- drafting messages for online forum; stackoverflow; biostars
- it will be cool if i can draft messages via meddium via R markdown

## Hummm? should there be space between harsh key and the begining of the heaeder; seem like it doesn't work everywhere.
## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
plot(cars$speed)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
Do you think it is good time to *sign off?*
Yes! **Sir!**
